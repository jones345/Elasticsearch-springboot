About Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an open-source, Java-written, distributed RESTful search engine. It has been built on top of Apache Lucene and extends Lucene’s functionality with HTTP web interface and data distribution using the index and shards concept. An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database. It organizes data under a namespace, has a defined schema, and can be divided into multiple shards for horizontal scaling. Each record in Elasticsearch is stored as a JSON object and is called a “document.”
 It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements. Elasticsearch provides a distributed system on top of Lucene StandardAnalyzer for indexing and automatic type guessing and utilizes a JSON based REST API to refer to Lucene features.

Some of the core features of Elasticsearch include:

Distributed search
High availability
REST interface
Powerful query DSL
Multitenancy
Geo search
Horizontal scaling
